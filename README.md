# calculator

### stuff to fix:
- expressions in which the second argument is negative don't work properly.
- when the result is negative, pressing a digit-key appends the numbers in front of the result, and performs the next calculation incorrectly.
- [might have to modify how key-presses are converted into expressions]
- design.
